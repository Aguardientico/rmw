Don't run these scripts directly - use 'make test` instead.

After running `configure` and `make`, you can run tests by changing to
the test/ directory (of your build directory) and run make followed by
any of these:

  test-basic
  test-purging

*Hint: typing `make test` and pressing the TAB key will show you
available options.

When you're done, enter `make testclean` to remove temporary files.
